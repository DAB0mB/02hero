02Hero is a JavaScript Crash Course which will teach you how to program using the JavaScript programming language. There are lots of great JavaScript crash courses out there, either these courses are free but lame or excellent but costly. Moreover, even the crash courses which I consider them to be excellent and actually worthy, miss lots of points and techniques which will turn you from someone who only knows the JavaScript language, to someone "speaks" the JavaScript language.

This tutorial is suitable for all people across the JavaScript prior knowledge spectrum. You can be a newbie with 0 knowledge about JavaScript, and you can be a software engineer who does it for a long time but wants to extend his knowledge even further by getting down to the tiniest grammatical details of the language.

You will be provided with free content like recorded videos, written manuals and code examples for each stage in this tutorial. Note that this tutorial is under construction and will be extended due time.

The only prerequisites for this tutorial are:
- Any environment which can run JavaScript.
- A very basic knowledge in computer science.
- Eagerness to learn.
